#Chat application

Real-time to-do list application built using React.js for the frontend and Node.js with Express.js for the backend.
The project uses Socket.IO for real-time updates, allowing users to see changes to the to-do list instantly. With
this setup, users can add and remove tasks in real time. This project is a example of integrating a full-stack
architecture using modern web technologies.
